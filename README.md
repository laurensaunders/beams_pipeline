# beams_pipeline

beams_pipeline is a tool that allows you to make a beam and then analyze the leakage spectra for that beam. 
You can use it to make a completely analytic beam simulation, or to use a real beam (from HFSS), and then 
analyze that beam using the Map Multi Tool code (https://github.com/CMB-S4/map_multi_tool).

Dependencies: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, map_multi_tool
