    "\n",
    "## What software do I need for this tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Beams Pipeline Tutorial! Before beginning, you will need the Map Multi Tool, as well as the beam systematics files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the Map Multi Tool on your computer, go to your command line or terminal and paste in:\n",
    "\n",
    "```git clone https://github.com/CMB-S4/map_multi_tool.git```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the beam systematics, paste in:\n",
    "\n",
    "```git clone https://github.com/laurensaunders/beams_pipeline.git```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need ```numpy```, ```scipy```, ```matplotlib```, ```math```, and ```time```, so make sure that each of those is also installed on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Beams\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do beams and beam perturbations look like in map space?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we study our beams, we look at the Stokes I, Q, U, and V parameters, although we do not generally expect a signficant V parameter component. In the case of a completely perfect beam, we expect our beam to be a perfect 2-dimensional Gaussian, with no leakage in any of the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/gaussian_beam_example.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Unperturbed Gaussian beam\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect beams, though, do not generally exist on real experiments, so we need to look at how different aberrations produce leakage in our maps. There are a few common ways that imperfections in the telescope optical system can make these imperfections.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's think about what happens when we have a mismatch of main-beam full width at half maximum (FWHM). In this case, when we look at the difference, we see a ring shape around the center of the beam, called a monopole:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/monopole_beam_example.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Monopole perturbation of a beam\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have differential pointing, the beam may create a double-lobed, or dipole, pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/dipole_beam_example.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Dipole perturbation of a beam\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "And when we have differential ellipticities, the beam creates a 4-lobed, or quadrupole, pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/quadrupole_beam_example.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Quadrupole perturbation of a beam\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "These effects are added to the beam, which creates a more complicated beam shape. Additionally, due to reflections or misalignment, we sometimes see a ghost beam, which looks like a copy of the main beam that shows up away from the center of the main beam:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/ghost_beam_example.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Gaussian beam with a ghost in the lower right corner\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The size scales of the features in the beam correspond to the $\\ell$ scales on which they appear when we look at the power spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship to Power Spectra and Leakage Spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our map-space beams, we can take Fourier transforms of the beams. We square these Fourier transforms to find the <i>window functions</i>. The transformed and squared I beam is the TT window function; the EE and BB window functions are calculated by squaring combinations of the Q and U beams. When we take power spectrum measurements of the CMB, we are actually measuring the beam multiplied with the CMB power spectrum. To find just the CMB power spectra, we need to divide out the beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to beam aberrations, we see leakage from temperature into the polarization, as well as from E to B mode polarization. Mathematically, the leakage spectra (T$\\rightarrow$E, T$\\rightarrow$B, and E$\\rightarrow$B) are found by multiplying the unsquared T, E, and B Fourier transforms together. We are most concerned with examining the T$\\rightarrow$E leakage, because it will be the greatest in magnitude and can bias our constraints on $r$. We are also interested in the E$\\rightarrow$B mode polarization leakage, as the magnitude of the E-mode power spectrum is so much larger than that of the B-mode spectrum, and we need to understand any spurious signal leaked into the B-mode power spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedhorns\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedhorns are horn-shaped cavities that act as waveguides as light from the CMB travels to the detectors. A cross-section of a feedhorn is shown here, along with a feedhorn array designed to fit with a detector wafer:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "    <img src=\"img/IMG_20191011_091008.jpg\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Cross-section of a 90/150 GHz feedhorn\"/>\n",
    "    <img src=\"img/IMG_20230321_122417.jpg\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Feedhorn array\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The beam shape is fully defined by the feedhorn, which makes it easier to model and to test the T$\\rightarrow$P leakage. For feedhorns, the primary systematic is beam ellipticity (which produces a quadrupole pattern). Because feedhorns produce easy-to-model beams, we will focus on these types of beams in this tutorial. Other optical elements, like sinusoidal antennas and rotating half-wave plates, can produce more complicated beam patterns and larger effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software and Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial, we will use the Map Multi Tool software, contained in its own Github repository, as well as the Beams Pipeline contained in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Map Multi Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The Map Multi Tool software is a new map-based tool for studying beam window functions and leakage spectra. The tool is useful for showing ways that CMB systematics such as crosstalk, pointing miscalibration, and optical irregularities that show up in the beams can produce this leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Map Multi Tool has two sample Jupyter notebooks that let you explore some of the software's functionality--both in a crosstalk implementation and in a beams implementation. Each of these notebooks has a simple model of the instrument scenario and walks through how to find the leakage spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beams Pipeline and Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "The beams pipeline is a tool that allows you to make a beam and then analyze the leakage spectra for that beam. You can use it to make a completely analytic beam simulation, or to use a simulated or measured beam (from HFSS), and then analyze that beam. You can then use some functions that interface with Map Multi Tool to find the leakage spectra of your beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll look at beams produced by feedhorns (both using analytic simulations and HFSS-generated simulations), so our main form of beam aberration will be the quadrupole we see from differential ellipticity. We'll demonstrate the different levels of beam leakage between T$\\rightarrow$E, E$\\rightarrow$B, and T$\\rightarrow$B to show the dominant leakage modes, and explore why this might be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this tutorial has pre-filled values for the beam parameters, you can try changing the values of these parameters to see what happens with different telescope designs. We'll walk through the initial examples, and then have some time to work through exercises that explore different beam parameters and different leakage spectra."
